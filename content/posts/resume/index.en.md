So the presentation of the resume and whether it can be read by him is very important. You have to think of yourself as an interviewer, and think from the interviewer's point of view. What content do you want to see?

## Basic skills of resume

* You don't need to write too much basic information, you don't need to write down where you were born, how many people in your family, just a simple name, phone number, address and other basic information.
* There needs to be obvious content classification, mainly in the four major categories, basic information, work experience, highest education, and related skills.
* The resume should preferably not exceed one page, unless you need to put a portfolio or some supplementary information, no matter how many years of work experience, try to condense the essence in this page (the most important and the most recent The work experience is put on this page, and other relevant experience can be added during the interview) The most important thing is to arouse the interviewer's curiosity about you.
* If you are a student, you just came out of the society without any work experience, you can put the projects or related courses you did during your student days into your resume. Among them, if you have internship experience during your student period, it is more important, because many people have no work experience, so you must rely on internship experience to strengthen your resume (you really don’t have any relevant work experience, you can take those positions in the club, what things have been done and in which those goals have been achieved).

* To customize your resume, sometimes you will apply for different companies or different departments at the same time, and you need to customize your resume for the position of the company.
* For example, the interview company A emphasizes independent thinking, so you can write about the cases you have done in your resume, and company B requires teamwork ability, so you can write your own role in the team in the resume. , to achieve those goals together.

* Don't write about your weaknesses on your resume. Although you can't lie to deny what you don't know during an interview, your resume is a package. Your resume is the first impression you give to the interviewer. You have to present your best self. .
* On the resume, don't just say what you are very good at or which case you have done, you should do it in this case, what changes you have made, and what good effects have you brought to the company or such a case, it is best to use Use data to quantify your effectiveness (how much efficiency has been improved, how much money has been saved for the company), usually the case is done by a group, but you only need to emphasize your contribution.
