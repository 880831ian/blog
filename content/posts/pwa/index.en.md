## How to use

First, change the above information in manifest.json to the settings you want, put manifest.json and service-worker.js in the root directory of the webpage, and open the webpage you want to support. The following uses my [personal page](https:/ /pin-yi.com
) as an example.

1. Go to the editor and put manifest.json in the head

```html
<link rel="manifest" href="./manifest.json">
````
<br>

{{< image src="/images/pwa/1GveueD.png" width="700" caption="Example page" src_s="/images/pwa/1GveueD.png" src_l="/images/pwa/1GveueD.png" >}}

2. Add the following at the end of the program

````js
 <script>
          if ('serviceWorker' in navigator)
          {
          window.addEventListener('load', function() {
            navigator.serviceWorker.register('./service-worker.js')
            .then(function() { console.log("Service Worker Registered, Cheers to PWA Fire!"); });
          }
          );
        }
    </script>
````
<br>
