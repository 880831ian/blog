There is a saying circulating on the Internet that Taiwanese must do 3 things in life

<!--more-->

* Mount Yushan
* Swimming across Sun Moon Lake
* Cycling around the island

{{< admonition note "內文" ture >}}
Although I should never want to cycle around the island in my life
But locomotive round the island is a dream of mine a long time ago

When I was a freshman, I just learned to ride a bike and liked to run around very much.
I once made an appointment with a group of friends to go round the island in my sophomore year,
Too bad I didn't have time to do it.

This time, I set off in my free time before work after discharge from the military,
There are blue sky and white clouds on the way, and there are also violent storms, and most of the latter 🥲

Let me see a different view of Taiwan
It is also a great gift for me before work 🎁
